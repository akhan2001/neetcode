- we need a slow and fast pointer
- iterate through the linked list with the fast pointer
- fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer
- when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle
- return the slow pointer (print outs the middle node and rest of the list)
