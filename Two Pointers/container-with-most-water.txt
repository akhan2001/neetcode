- printed out all the values
- through while loop print out all the possible heights
- simple algorithm was finding the amount when going increment to lower values
- whichever height is lower, you only increment that
- if both heights are same, increment both
- only change the maxAmount value if it is greater
- Struggles: not much, pretty straightforward with two pointers
