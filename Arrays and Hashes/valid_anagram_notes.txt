Anagram does not care about the order of the chars. I can sort them and check if the strings are equal.

1. I first created two HashTables, set the values with their frequency amount accordingly. Fixed bugs.
2. Best optimal way is to sort the two arrays into char arrays and then check if they're equal from there.
